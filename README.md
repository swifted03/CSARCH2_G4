## 1. Introduction
Per the course deliverables for CSARCH2, case study project #1 is about constructing a custom desktop PC build based on the given specifications about the budget and expected system performance. Our build expects high performance at 1440p, and solid performance at 4K, even in the most demanding AAA title games. Our build should also be future-proof for at least four years. This PC build is packed with the latest high-end components that synchronize well with each other, delivering the optimal performance for the price. This PC build targets users who play demanding AAA titles, such as Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, and Clair Obscur Expedition 33, who want to maximize their gaming experience with stunning visuals while not compromising FPS. The build is also suitable for productivity work, such as 3D Modelling, Data Science, and AI model training.

This PC build incorporates a budget of 100,000 pesos with an allowance of an extra 5%, which makes the budget constraint at a maximum of 105,000 pesos. Our group ensured that we would stay within the budget by scavenging through various reputable local suppliers such as Bermore Techzone, Dynaquest, EasyPC, and many more. Lastly, these stores are in Metro Manila, with the stock and prices subject to day-to-day change. The prices here reflect those before the project deadline, where the components were also readily available.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
- **CPU + Motherboard**: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (AM5) works with MSI PRO B850M-P WIFI board (AM5 socket, BIOS compatible).
- **CPU Cooler**: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE (L125 × W110 × H155 mm (size)) fits inside the Lian Li Lancool 217 case (max CPU height clearance of 180mm).  
- **RAM**: DDR5 RAM supported by motherboard slots (up to 256GB). Rated 6000 MT/s requires enabling AMD EXPO in BIOS for full speed.
- **SSD**: Supported by the motherboard’s three M.2 slots, with PCIe 5.0 x4 (M.2_1) and PCIe 4.0 x4/x2 (M.2_2 & M.2_3) depending on CPU and slot.
- **HDD**: Supported by the motherboard’s SATA 6Gb/s ports (4 available).
- **GPU**: AMD RX 9070 XT (340mm x 142mm x 49mm (size with bracket)) fits inside the Lian Li Lancool 217 case (max GPU length clearance of 380mm). PSU wattage sufficient.
