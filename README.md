## 1. Introduction
Per the course deliverables for CSARCH2, case study project #1 is about constructing a custom desktop PC build based on the given specifications about the budget and expected system performance. Our build expects high performance at 1440p, and solid performance at 4K, even in the most demanding AAA title games. Our build should also be future-proof for at least four years. This PC build is packed with the latest high-end components that synchronize well with each other, delivering the optimal performance for the price. This PC build targets users who play demanding AAA titles, such as Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, and Clair Obscur Expedition 33, who want to maximize their gaming experience with stunning visuals while not compromising FPS. The build is also suitable for productivity work, such as 3D Modelling, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

This PC build incorporates a budget of 100,000 pesos with an allowance of an extra 5%, which makes the budget constraint at a maximum of 105,000 pesos. Our group ensured that we would stay within the budget by scavenging through various reputable local suppliers such as Bermore Techzone, Dynaquest, EasyPC, and many more. Lastly, these stores are in Metro Manila, with the stock and prices subject to day-to-day change. The prices here reflect those before the project deadline, where the components were also readily available.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
- **CPU + Motherboard**: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (AM5) works with MSI PRO B850M-P WIFI board (AM5 socket, BIOS compatible).
- **CPU Cooler**: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE (L125 × W110 × H155 mm (size)) fits inside the Lian Li LANCOOL 217 case (max CPU height clearance of 180mm).  
- **RAM**: DDR5 RAM supported by motherboard slots (up to 256GB). Rated 6000 MT/s requires enabling AMD EXPO in BIOS for full speed.
- **SSD**: Supported by the motherboard’s three M.2 slots, with PCIe 5.0 x4 (M.2_1) and PCIe 4.0 x4/x2 (M.2_2 & M.2_3) depending on CPU and slot.
- **HDD**: Supported by the motherboard’s SATA 6Gb/s ports (4 available).
- **GPU**: AMD RX 9070 XT (340mm x 142mm x 49mm (size with bracket)) fits inside the Lian Li LANCOOL 217 case (max GPU length clearance of 380mm). PSU wattage sufficient.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱105,000  
- **Final Total**: ₱104,510  
- ✅ Within budget
- Notes on trade-offs:
  - Settled for a high-quality air cooler (Thermalright Peerless Assassin) instead of an AIO liquid cooler to save budget for a better motherboard, while still maintaining sufficient cooling for the 7800X3D.
  - Chose a budget-friendly but reliable 32GB DDR5-6000 CL36 kit (G.Skill Flare X5) instead of a faster one. This saved money for other components while still providing dual-channel bandwidth and sufficient RAM capacity for heavy tasks.
  - Settled for 1TB NVMe SSD + 1TB HDD instead of higher-capacity drives (e.g., 2TB NVMe or larger HDD) to save budget for other high-priority components.
  - Exhibited maximum budget allocation for CPU (Ryzen 7 7800X3D) and GPU (RX 9070 XT) to maximize raw performance.
  - Made the motherboard (MSI PRO B850M-P WIFI), PSU (Corsair RM850X 850w), and case (Lian Li LANCOOL 217) second priorities in the budget to accommodate premium features, endurance, and aesthetics.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

Throughout this case study, our group learned a lot about the various components of a computer and how they interact and depend on each other. Dependencies and interconnectedness are crucial aspects in PC building. It takes domain knowledge in computer hardware to ensure that components seamlessly work together, such as CPU socket types, memory standards, power requirements, and interface types like PCIe and SATA. While initially daunting, information about these topics is readily available online for any beginner PC builder to digest. 

We learned the importance of balancing performance, budget, and future-proofing, where trade-offs come into play. Regarding raw performance, the CPU and GPU are the most instrumental components affecting computational power. We learned that prioritizing these components above everything is key to building a powerful computer. Aside from that, we also learned that we cannot cheap out on the other components that the CPU and GPU depend on, specifically the PSU and motherboard. The PSU is critical as a low-quality power supply can easily damage the high-end components. A PSU should inherently be reliable, so investing in a fully-modular, gold-certified one is the bare minimum for an expensive system like this. Moreover, the motherboard has its voltage regulator modules (VRMs) that manage power delivery to the other components, so investing in a decent motherboard is also important. Components generally not critical to system performance are the case, cooling, RAM, and storage, where it is easier to budget components as needed. 

With this, trade-offs are not only affected by the parts themselves, as they are subject to the components' availability from local distributors. Throughout this case study, we experienced challenges in finding cheap and available stock from reputable sellers. We overcame this by working together to scour the internet for more reputable vendors to add to our canvassing list. Additionally, international vs local pricing was also a challenge. GPUs are especially expensive in the current market, so finding an RX 9070 XT for close to MSRP was tough; luckily, we found a near-MSRP one from Bermore Techzone. 

This case study was very insightful and fun for the entire group. Theorizing PC builds with our budget was a nice activity to get exposed to the current tech landscape, as more and more advancements to computer hardware come into place. We want to use the knowledge we have gained in our future endeavors whenever we want to build a new computer, to construct one with a respectable performance akin to its price.
